## Elevator Pitch
Frilode will be a platform where there are 3 types of users: A) those who own recreational vehicle renting businesses, B) those who own a recreational vehicle, and C) those who want to rent a recreational vehicle. I'm connecting these 3 groups together to allow them to be more efficent. Imagine Turo but for recreational vehicles! Turo is an excellent and well built platform for renting out a personal car-- like Airbnb for cars. I want to create a website that allows and is focused on recreational vehicles. There needs to be a different platform from Turro as recreational vehicles require much more upkeep and require more attention than a car does. There isn't a platform that implements Waivers, Training videos, Insurance and Pictures for before and after. A larger database of vehicles would help business owners decide on a better price for renting, helps thier marketing, and helps with their software issues when booking multiday rentals.

## Design

- CSS: great styling and animating so that the SaS looks official
- JavaScript: user needs to be able to click through the infomration on the website to see and book vehicles

- WebSocket: support for pushing data to the server and pulling data from the server (photos, info on vehicles, times booked)
- Web framework: add components and request routing
~~- ability to collect credit card info and bill~~
~~- abilit to send owners money for renters~~
~~- ability to book vehicle for a selected period of days, won't make it available for other users to book on same days~~
(CC collecting beyone the scope of this class, I spoke with a TA today. I'll implement later and i'll find instructions online).
(for now i'll take them to a landing page where i can collect thier emails and information)
Questions:
- security?
- how to automate a new page so it's not hard coded?
